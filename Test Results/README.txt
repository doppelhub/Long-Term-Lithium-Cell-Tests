I do not publicly post most cell data I gather. If you would like information on a cell I haven't publicly posted, please send me a message on github and I will consider posting data publicly.  If I haven't already tested the cell you ask for, I will also consider testing the cell free of charge, but only if the results are potentially valuable for my own use.  Running this test is takes considerable time and also consumes quite a bit of power ($), so please understand if I'm unwilling to test a cell for you that I won't derive any value from testing.  Notably, I am primarily interested in testing cells that can withstand 100 A discharge and 70 A charge continuously for at least three months.
