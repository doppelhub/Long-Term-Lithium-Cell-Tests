This test charged at 70 amps up to 3.56 volts.
This test discharged into a 32.4 mOhm load (~110 amps at 3.56 volts) down to 2.9 volts.

Cell started at 24 degC
At cycle 3 it was 50 degC
At cycle 12 it was 65 degC

Test stopped after cycle 444 to perform 30 & 100 amps testing for a few cycles.

Data starting at cycle 445 is verified accurate, and is likely due to Claim M in my discussion thread.
