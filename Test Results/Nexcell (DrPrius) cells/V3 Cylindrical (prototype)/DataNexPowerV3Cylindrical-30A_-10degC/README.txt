This test charged at 30 amps up to 3.56 volts.
This test discharged at 30 amps down to 2.9 volts.

Cell started at -10 degC
Before cycle 1, the cell was removed from thermal chamber and placed outdoors in ~25 degC temp.

Test procedure:
1: A test cell is initially soaked in a thermal chamber at -10 degC.
2a: Before the test begins, the cell is removed from the thermal chamber and placed in a 23 degC ambient environment**.
2b: During this test, the cell is able to warm due to both internal and ambient (23 degC) heating.
3: A 30 amp charge current is applied to the cell until the cell voltage increases to the 'full' setpoint (3.56 volts).
4: The cell is immediately discharged at 30 amps until the cell voltage decreases tot he 'empty' setpoint (2.90 volts).
5: Steps 3 & 4 are repeated until the user stops the test.
