This long term cell tester uses QTY4 lambda gen supplies to continuously charge and discharge two cells.  The two cells charge/discharge independently from each other.
Each complete cycle is logged in the "Data" and "Data2" folders, which must be present for the vi to work.

Requires LV2010, with custom Lambda Gen driver.
