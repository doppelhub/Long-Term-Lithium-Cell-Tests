# Long Term Lithium Cell Tests
 Lithium cell charge/discharge results

Test data collected from various lithium cells.

Tester information:

Head 1:
Maximum charge rate: 170 amps
Maximum discharge rate: 250 amps

Head 2:
Maximum charge rate: 52.5 amps
Maximum discharge rate: 120 amps

Both charge heads are controlled by TDK Lambda Gen power supplies.
Both discharge heads are controlled by TDK Lambda Gen power supplies, which activate an open drain MOSFET, which discharges into a variable-length 4 AWG wire.
